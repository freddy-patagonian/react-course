### Section 1: React Essentials - Deep Dive

- JSX vs React.createElement()
- JSX it's not necessary but it's convenient.

#### Components as props: Slots

- The prop `children` it's recognized by React and it will render anything inside the component tags `<>{children node}</>`
- Another React Node props can be defined and rendered inside the component
- If you want to add a slot for a wrapper component it could be done like this:

  - `<MyComponent wrapperComponent={CustomComponent}>` For custom components. Note it's only passing the name itself and not te component between tags!
